My skin is naked, my skin is virgin
My skin is white, white lake the snow
Only some pimples and a big fat wart
Oh tattoed man I adore you so
You're passing by, an eagle on your back
Swords cross your chest and snakes around your arm
I'm afraid of blood and pain
My naked skin drives me insane
You're standing here, a dragon signed your calf
Hell what a shame! I'm a tattooed coward man

Fear! Fear! Fear of tattoos!
Fear! Fear! Fear of tattoos!
Fear! Fear! Fear of tattoos!

You are so cool, tongues of fire lick your leg
I want a skull and spiders on my neck
I'm afraid of blood and pain
My naked skin drives me insane
I love tattoos but I can't stand this hell
Needles of horror, I am a tattoo whimp

You're standing here, a dragon signed your calf
Hell what a shame! I'm a tattooed coward man
I'm afraid of blood and pain
My naked skin drives me insane
I love tattoos but I can't stand this hell
Needles of horror, I am a tattoo whimp

My skin is naked, my skin is virgin
My skin is white, white lake the snow
Only some pimples and a big fat wart
Oh tattoed man I adore you so

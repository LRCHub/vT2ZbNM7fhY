Like a needle in my eyes
Oh yeah, all because, because of you
Heal the pain on ice
It woke up black and blue
You told me that you loved me
And then you told the truth
Told me that it's over
I've got the living proof
I can't forget the look upon your face
I wish I could you know, the pain I can't erase

I've got a brand new name on an old tattoo
Better hold the train than to face loving you
You're under my skin, get out of my heart
I knew it was trouble from the start
What else can I do?
Got a brand new name on an old tattoo

A place like Dallas sunset
It helped me make the change
And the words are over
And nothing stays the same
So now I'm getting over you
You got me like a knife

I can't forget the look upon your face
I wish I could do it, this pain I can't erase
I remember when we'd been
Our love it was instant stone
But the pain has ruined everything
Woah!

I've got a brand new name on an old tattoo
Better hold the train than to face loving you
You're under my skin, get out of my heart
I knew it was trouble from the start
What else can I do?
Got a brand new name on an old tattoo

I forgot your number, but I don't forget your face
The only time I can look at you
Pain I can't erase

You're under my skin, get outta my heart
I knew it was trouble from the start
What else can I do?
Got a brand new name on an old tattoo

Got a brand new name on an old tattoo
Better hold the train than to face loving you
You're under my skin, get out of my heart
I knew it was trouble from the start
What else can I do?
Got a brand new name on an old tattoo

Got a brand new name on an old tattoo
Better hold the train than to face loving you
You're under my skin, get out of my heart
I knew it was trouble from the start
What else can I do?
Got a brand new name on an old tattoo

Got a brand new name on an old tattoo
Better hold the train than to face loving you
You're under my skin, get out of my heart
I knew it was trouble from the start

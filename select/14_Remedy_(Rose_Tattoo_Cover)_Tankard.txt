Get out of the streets
Get out of your cage
Start thinking sharp
You got to get smart and rage
Set yourself free
Set yourself free
Good rockin' music is all we need

It's gonna save your head
Gonna save your soul
Good old fashioned
Good time remedy
They call Rock'n'Roll

Ain't no time for settin' down
You got a whole lot of noise
To make in this town
Rock'n'Roll it's goin' around
You got to pick it up and start layin' down

Don't waste my time with fancy prancing
Just Rock'n'Roll and get everybody dancin'
Take your worries out and throw then away
They make you old
They're gonna make you grey

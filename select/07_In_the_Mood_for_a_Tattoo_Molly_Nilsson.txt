There's nothing like it
Can't be described
There's nothing like it even if you do survive
And let's say
We never met we never will
Let's play
With our regrets from here until
Eternity is a dangerous word
One of those words I wish I never heard
But the time is now
It's now or never
From here until forever
I'll be here until forever

Stars may go and they're too old to know
But the skies they wait 'til it's already too late
The stars they know but I'm too young to know
But the skies they wait 'til it's already too late
I heard a scientist said
My lucky star might be dead

Something stolen or something new
I'm in the mood for a tattoo
Something borrowed or something new
I'm in the mood for a tattoo
And like the stars I'll follow you wherever you are
Your lucky star will follow you wherever you are
And once you know just how it goes
It's not so scary anymore
Close the window
Shut the door!

I want revenge
I want something sweet
It hurts so good
With every bite I eat
Let's say
We never met
We never will
Let's play
Let's play

Something stolen or something new
I'm in the mood for a tattoo
Something borrowed or something new
I'm in the mood for a tattoo
And like the stars I'll follow you wherever you are
Your lucky star will follow you wherever you are
The time is now
Now or never
I'm here until forever
I'll be here until forever
